In our last Rubber Duck Thursdays stream of 2025, I wanted to build something
celebratory. Something that captures what Rubber Duck Thursdays is all about:
building together, learning from mistakes, and celebrating everyone who tunes
in from across the world.

Along the way, I picked up practical patterns for working with AI that you can
apply to your own projects, whether you’re building a countdown app or
something entirely different. From managing context windows to avoid cluttered
conversations, to using the [Plan
agent](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-
planning?utm_campaign=rdt-blog-
devrel&utm_source=github_blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=2025-12-18_countdown-
copilot) for requirement discovery, to catching edge cases through test-driven
development with Copilot. And… why world maps are harder than they look. 👀

_See the full stream below_. 👇

## Starting simple: The basic countdown

Countdown timers are a straightforward concept. Days countdown to hours.
Minutes countdown to seconds. But sometimes it’s the simple ideas that allow
us to be our most creative. I figured I’d use this as an opportunity to use
Copilot in a spec or requirements-driven approach, to build a countdown app
that brought anticipation and displayed fireworks as it turned to the new
year.

Fortunately, software development is an iterative process and this livestream
embraced that fully. While some requirements were well-defined, others evolved
in real time, shaped by suggestions from our livestream audience. Custom
agents like the Plan agent helped bridge the gap, turning ambiguous ideas into
structured plans I could act on. So let’s start at the very beginning, setting
up the project.

I generated a new workspace with GitHub Copilot, using a very specific prompt.
The prompt explained that we’re building a countdown app and that I wanted to
use [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite),
[TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), and [Tailwind CSS
v4](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss). It also explained some of
the requirements including the dark theme, centred layout, large bold digits
with subtle animation, target midnight on January, 2026 by default, with some
room for customizations.

    
    
    #new 
    
    1. Create a new workspace for a New Year countdown app using Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4.
    
    **Setup requirements:**
    - Use the @tailwindcss/vite plugin (Tailwind v4 style)
    - Dark theme by default (zinc-900 background)
    - Centered layout with the countdown as the hero element
    
    **Countdown functionality:**
    Create a `countdown.ts` module with:
    - A `CountdownTarget` type that has `{ name: string, date: Date }` so we can later customize what we're counting down to
    - A `getTimeRemaining(target: Date)` function returning `{ days, hours, minutes, seconds, total }`
    - A `formatTimeUnit(n: number)` helper that zero-pads to 2 digits
    - Default target: midnight on January 1st of NEXT year (calculate dynamically from current date)
    
    **Display:**
    - Large, bold countdown digits (use tabular-nums for stable width)
    - Labels under each unit (Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds)
    - Subtle animation when digits change (CSS transition)
    - Below the countdown, show: "until [target.name]" (e.g., "until 2026")
    
    **Architecture:**
    - `src/countdown.ts` - pure logic, no DOM
    - `src/main.ts` - sets up the interval and updates the DOM
    - Use `requestAnimationFrame` or `setInterval` at 1 second intervals
    - Export types so they're reusable
    
    Keep it simple and clean—this is the foundation we'll build themes on top of.

What I love about the “generate new workspace” feature is that Copilot
generated [custom instruction
files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-
instructions?utm_campaign=rdt-blog-
devrel&utm_source=github_blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=2025-12-18_countdown-
copilot) for me, automatically capturing my requirements, including the
countdown app, Vite, TypeScript, and dark theme. It was all documented before
writing a single line of code.

![Screenshot of a conversation with Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code.

Year countdown app using Vite, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4. It's going to
to use the create_new_workspace tool to create the new
workspace.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/setup-
info.png?resize=1024%2C314)

Within minutes, I had a working countdown. Days, hours, minutes, and seconds
ticking down to 2026. While it worked, it wasn’t visually exciting. In
fairness, I hadn’t specified any design or theme preferences in my initial
prompt. So it was time to iterate and make it more interesting.

During the stream, viewers were joining from India, Nigeria, Italy, the United
States (the list goes on!); developers from around the world, coming together
to learn. One person in the chat made a suggestion that adjusted what we’d do
next: _What about time zones?_

It wasn’t a requirement I’d expected to work on during the stream, so I didn’t
have a clear plan of how it would work. Maybe there is a globe that you could
spin to select timezones. Maybe there was a world map with a time travel
theme. That’s a lot of maybes. My requirements were vague, which was where I
turned to the Plan agent.

## Plan agent: The questions I hadn’t thought to ask

I’ve been using [Plan
agent](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-
planning?utm_campaign=rdt-blog-
devrel&utm_source=github_blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=2025-12-18_countdown-
copilot) more deliberately lately, especially when I feel that my
requirements aren’t fully defined. The Plan agent doesn’t create a plan based
on my initial prompt, it asks clarifying questions that can reveal edge cases
you may not have considered.

![Screenshot of the input box for Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code. The
input box contains a prompt with some requirements that configure an
interactive timezone selector either like a time machine dial, or a mini world
map.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/timezone-
selector.png?resize=1024%2C406)

I gave it my rough idea: interactive time zone selector, time travel theme,
animate between zones, maybe a world map. The Plan agent came back with
questions that made me think:

| **Question** | **Why it mattered** |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
Should the circular dial be primary with the world map as secondary, or vice
versa?| I hadn’t decided the visual hierarchy  
What happens on mobile: dropdown fallback or touch-friendly scroll?| I was
only thinking of a desktop implementation for this initial version. Mobile
could be a future requirement.  
When a time zone passes midnight, show “already celebrating” with confetti, or
a timer showing how long since midnight?| I wanted the celebration, not a
reverse countdown. I wasn’t clear on my requirements.  
Would there be subtle audio feedback when spinning the dial, or visual only?|
Bringing audio into the app was scope creep, but it could be a future
requirement.  
  
This is the beauty of working with AI in this way. The Plan agent makes you
think, potentially asking a clarifying question and offering options A or B.
But as you reflect, you realize the answer is somewhere in between.

For example, in my second iteration of requirements, the plan asked whether
fireworks should run continuously, burst once, or loop subtly. I replied that
there’s probably a performance consideration, and we should opt for somewhere
in the middle. We also asked the livestream viewers to vote on whether we
should implement the component as a dial or map. Map won, so we pivoted to a
world map as the primary selector with eight featured locations.

## Context window management: Just keep what you need

Before implementing, I deliberately started a new [chat
session](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-
chat?utm_campaign=rdt-blog-
devrel&utm_source=github_blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=2025-12-18_countdown-
copilot).

The context from our previous conversation (workspace creation, basic
countdown logic) wasn’t needed anymore. And any context that might have been
useful was now included in our custom instructions file. When working with AI
tools, that context window is precious. Bringing in irrelevant history
clutters the conversation and dilutes focus. So I cleared it, bringing only
what mattered: the new requirements, the Plan agent output (which I’d asked
Copilot to write to a separate Markdown file), and fresh focus on time zones.

I also reused some custom instruction files, [custom
agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-
agents?utm_campaign=rdt-blog-
devrel&utm_source=github_blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=2025-12-18_countdown-
copilot), and [prompt
files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-
files?utm_campaign=rdt-blog-
devrel&utm_source=github_blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=2025-12-18_countdown-
copilot) from another personal project to help steer Copilot in the right
direction, and incorporate specialized agents for relevant tasks. This
included a UI Performance Specialist agent.

💡 **Did you know?** GitHub Copilot’s [custom
agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-
agents?utm_campaign=rdt-blog-
devrel&utm_source=github_blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=2025-12-18_countdown-
copilot) let you create specialised personas for different development tasks.
The UI Performance Specialist agent that I built during the stream is just one
example. You can create agents for security reviews, architecture planning, or
any role-specific workflow. The [awesome-copilot repository has a number of
examples](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/tree/main/agents).

## Implementation: Modular, test-driven, and that map

With the Plan agent’s work complete, I switched to my UI Performance
Specialist agent and asked it to review the plan, suggesting deeper
implementation details based on its expertise.

![: Screenshot of Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code. The agent selector shows
"UI Performance Specialist", with a prompt asking the agent to review the plan
and to provide implementation details.](https://github.blog/wp-
content/uploads/2026/01/vis-concept.png?resize=1024%2C455)

Context is important here, so I didn’t create a new conversation. Instead, I
continued the existing one. The agent came back with a detailed set of
considerations:

  * Frame time budgets for animations
  * Map SVG size optimisation strategies
  * Celebration particle limits (DOM element concerns) and cleanup considerations
  * Animation property recommendations (transform/opacity only)
  * Reduced motion support

It looked good, but I added a couple of additional requirements. I asked the
custom agent to make the implementation modular, to write the tests first
based on expected behaviour, and once it had failing tests, to write the
implementation.

That’s right: [test-driven development with
Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/guides/test-driven-
development-guide).

### The TDD Cycle

Copilot created test files for time zone utilities, city state management, and
the countdown logic. All failing tests in a red state. Good (one of the few
times where we want to see failing tests)!

![Screenshot of Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code showing GitHub Copilot
following a TDD cycle; failing tests first, then
implementation.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/write-
tests.png?resize=1024%2C380)

Then it implemented:

  * Time zone utilities using the [Intl.DateTimeFormat API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat)
  * City state with featured locations (New York, London, Tokyo, Sydney, etc.)
  * [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) persistence for selected time zones
  * App state management

With access to tools, the custom agent also executed tests in the terminal.
Two test cases failed: the logic that determined whether the celebration was
being triggered correctly between year rollovers. The tests were expecting
that celebrations were handled at midnight, and the duration since the
celebrations began.

![Screenshot of Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code showing GitHub Copilot

set of tests.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/timezones-
ts.png?resize=1024%2C398)

Since Copilot had access to the output, the custom agent caught the test
failures, adjusted the timezone implementation, and the tests went green.

💡 **Thought:** This is exactly why TDD and thinking about code quality
matters. Just like us developers, AI-assisted development can get things
wrong. Tests help us catch bugs before users do. The year rollover edge case
would have been embarrassing to discover on December 31, given that it was the
core capability of the app!

But some bugs turn into features. I found one bug too funny to fix
immediately. Let’s talk about the world map.

### The World map, maybe?

When I opened the app, the countdown worked. The time zone selector worked.
The calculations were correct, and switching from New York to Tokyo showed the
proper time difference.

But the world map? It didn’t quite render as expected. What appeared on screen
was more abstract art than geography. But it really made me laugh on stream.

![Screenshot from the countdown app. It has several dots placed for locations
across the world, but the world map has rendered as a series of abstract
shapes to represent islands, instead of a true version of the world
map.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/world-
map.png?resize=1024%2C719)

💡 **Thought:** I was ambitious specifying a world map without providing enough
context. No SVG asset, no reference to an existing mapping library. Just “add
a mini world map.” A reminder that AI can get things wrong.

Could I have fixed it? Absolutely. But we were over an hour into the stream,
and had more features to build. So I left it. The map was a perfect example of
iterative development where things don’t always go right the first time. (Can
you tell that we build things live yet?)

## Fireworks: Building anticipation toward midnight

A countdown on its own is functional, but fireworks add celebration and give
some visual flare (See what I did there?).

I switched back to the Plan agent and created a new chat thread (again,
context window management, prompting Copilot to build out a plan):

  * Use [Fireworks.js](https://github.com/crashmax-dev/fireworks-js) for the effects
  * Set the fireworks behaviour based on time remaining
  * If the timer has more than 24 hours left, don’t display fireworks, just show ambient stars
  * If the timer has between 24 to 12 hours remaining, set off fireworks every 30 seconds
  * Between one hour and 10 minutes remaining, the intensity of the fireworks should build
  * And finally, in the last 10 seconds we should have continuous fireworks for maximum celebration

I also asked for a skyline silhouette at the bottom of the screen, a dark
night sky gradient, and a theme controller. Plus, one critical testing
requirement: “Add a query parameter so I can specify how many minutes away we
are from midnight as an override for manual testing.” While I enjoy streaming
with our community, I’m not sure that everyone would have enjoyed hanging
around until the turn of 2026 to see the results!

The Plan agent asked for further clarification on how to display the stars
(either setting them as CSS, or setting them as low-intensity fireworks), as
well as some considerations around performance. It also asked about toggle
placement, which caught me out. I didn’t remember asking for a toggle button
and may have missed that in an iteration of the plan.

After carefully reviewing the plan, the Plan agent that I originally requested
an animation toggle for accessibility. This is why I like the Plan agent. It’s
rubber ducking with AI that has the context of your conversation, and can
check whether those requirements still make sense.

![Screenshot of Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code showing an interaction
where Copilot asks clarifying questions to confirm the
requirements.](https://github.blog/wp-
content/uploads/2026/01/toggle.png?resize=1024%2C381)

Once Copilot and I renegotiated the requirements, we used that familiar test-
driven development approach. One test failed initially as the JSDOM
environment setup was missing. Copilot spotted the failure, identified the
misconfigured testing configuration, and made the fix. After that, all tests
went green.

We now had an app with fireworks at different intensity levels, an animated
starfield using CSS, a city skyline, reduced motion support, and a query
parameter override.

### Testing the Intensity Levels

I added `?minutesToMidnight=1` to the URL. Fireworks appeared with medium
intensity, building excitement with increasing amounts of colors and particles
across the sky. At “midnight,” Happy New Year appeared with even more
celebration. The intensity curve felt right, the buildup created anticipation
and the finale delivered.

![Screenshot from the countdown app, showing the timer has reached 0 and
fireworks are being shown on screen to celebrate.](https://github.blog/wp-
content/uploads/2026/01/fireworks.png?resize=1024%2C640)

## Reveal: What I built that morning

But I didn’t stop there. Throughout the stream, I’d been teasing that I’d made
another countdown app earlier that morning, something with a very relevant
theme. Our viewers guessed another fireworks countdown, a confetti timer, and
even an “elicitation-powered tic-tac-toe” (which, to be fair, [we have built
before](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/building-your-first-mcp-
server-how-to-extend-ai-tools-with-custom-capabilities/)).

But as a GitHub stream, there was only one way that we could finish it off. We
had to have a contribution graph themed countdown!

The countdown sat in the centre in front of an animated contribution graph.
Each square flickered with green contributions appearing and disappearing
across the grid in waves. And just like the fireworks theme, as the countdown
ticked closer to zero, more squares lit up and the intensity built.

![Screenshot from a GitHub contribution graph themed countdown app. It shows
2026 in green blocks, layered on top of a contribution graph that has several
squares active with different shades of green to represent
contributions.](https://github.blog/wp-
content/uploads/2026/01/2026.png?resize=1024%2C458)

This stream was a celebration. A way to bring our community together across
time zones, all of us building and counting down to the same moment in our own
corners of the world.

During the stream, someone asked about the best programming languages for
landing jobs. My answer was the same as my approach to this project: find the
thing that brings you joy, and then the right tools and languages just fall
into place. I built this GitHub countdown theme because it brought me joy.
Because I wanted to make something “GitHubby,” and because I enjoy building
visual experiences.

Since that stream, I’ve worked on bringing these two projects into a unified
[open source countdown app,
Timestamp](http://github.com/chrisreddington/timestamp/). It has a centralized
theme orchestrator, allowing developers to plug into a common architecture and
extend with new themes. Every countdown is a URL so can be easily shared, and
there are several countdown modes to choose from (local time, absolute moments
and timers).

You can [check out the live app](https://chrisreddington.github.io/timestamp)
and [review the codebase](http://github.com/chrisreddington/timestamp). You’re
welcome to take a look at the repository, star it, fork it, and even
contribute a new theme.

I hope this inspires you to build that one project that has been on the
backlog, and spend some time on the thing that brings you a little bit of joy.

## What have we learned?

  * **Context window management is a skill.** Start new chat sessions when old context isn’t needed. Keep conversations focused. It’s [context engineering](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/want-better-ai-outputs-try-context-engineering/), not just prompt engineering.

  * **The Plan agent asks questions you may have forgotten.** Use it when requirements are vague. Let it reveal edge cases through clarifying questions. Sometimes the answer to A or B is “somewhere in the middle.”

  * **Custom agents are specialised helpers.** My UI Performance Specialist had expertise in frame budgets, animation properties, and accessibility. It gave implementation details while the plan agent helped ask clarifying questions to determine the scope. Specialisation matters.

  * **TDD with Copilot works.** Write tests first. Let them fail. Implement to pass. Just like us developers, AI-assisted tools produce bugs. We need to use those same practices that we’re used to for checking quality (builds, linters, and tests) to catch issues before users do.

  * **Things won’t always work the first time. That’s okay.** The world map didn’t render as expected, and I left it that way until my significant refactor and rebuild of the countdown app. Authentic development means showing the messy middle, not just polished outcomes. We learn from unexpected results as much as from successes.

  * **Scope ambitiously, implement iteratively.** We went from basic countdown, to time zones, to intense fireworks, to a separate contribution graph themed countdown. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and you don’t need everything on day one.

**What will you build in 2026?** Drop by the next [Rubber Duck Thursdays
stream](https://gh.io/rubberduckthursdays) at 10:30 a.m. UK time and 2:00 p.m.
Eastern time, and let’s build something that brings us joy, which hasn’t quite
reached the top of the “some day” list!
